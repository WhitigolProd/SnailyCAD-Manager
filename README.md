# SnailyCAD Manager v2

**SnailyCAD Manager v2** is beginning it's development. The roadmap for v2 is still yet vague. But since I was unhappy with the functionality of **SnailyCAD Manager v1**, I have decided to rebuild the app from the ground, up. For now, all the files in this repo will be replacing all the files from v1. You can find an archive of v1 [here](https://github.com/WhitigolProd/SnailyCAD-Manager/tree/v1-archive). v2 will bring many more features, fixes, and overall functionality. I can't wait to see how this turns out!

> A huge thank you to Casper for developing such an amazing open-source MDT system for people, and a thanks to Sharki for assisting in the development of SCM v1!
>
> And a thank you to all who have used SnailyCAD Manager along it's development process.
