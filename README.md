# SnailyCAD Manager v2

**SnailyCAD Manager v2** is beginning it's development. The roadmap for v2 is still yet vague. But since I was unhappy with the functionality of **SnailyCAD Manager v1**, I have decided to rebuild the app from the ground, up. For now, all the files in this repo will be replacing all the files from v1. I will soon upload an archive of v1 for users who whish to fork/clone and use the code for themselves, as it is open source. But v2 I plan to have as a much better app.

> A huge thank you to Casper for developing such an amazing open-source MDT system for people, and a thanks to Sharki for assisting in the development of SCM v1!
>
> And a thank you to all who have used SnailyCAD Manager along it's development process.
